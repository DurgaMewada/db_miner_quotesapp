     - Remove quotes from favorites by tapping a delete icon.
   - Even if the user is offline, the favorite quotes are always accessible.

### 3. Dynamic Quotes Fetching via API
   - The app integrates with an external Quotes API to dynamically fetch quotes across various categories.
   - Users get new and fresh quotes regularly thanks to API integration.
